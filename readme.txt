Create interfaces (forms, reports, graphs etc.) from database tables already existing.

== Description ==

Adds interfaces to database tables on pages, posts, dashboard and custom menu groups within admin, to manage data.
This version is an alpha, proof of concept and there are a lot of bugs still present.
There is no documentation yet so you'll have to guess your way around.
I tried to make it as intuative as possable but due to the complex nature of it somethings may not be so easy to grasp.

Please dont use it in a production site just yet. It is under active development so changes will be frequent.
